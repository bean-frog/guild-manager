# guild-manager
assassins guild management system (TOM v2 and Frontend stuff)
tom is very barebones at the moment btw <br>
#### Running tom locally:
- install nodejs/npm
- go to directory
- run `npm audit fix --force` to get dependencies
- run `node index.js`
- check the console and there should be a message saying the bot is logged in
- DO NOT PASTE THE TOKEN ANYWHERE THATS BAD
